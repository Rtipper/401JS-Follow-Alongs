# React works exactly like a manual baseball scoreboard -- something happens, something changes on the board

# Header | Footer | Body = components in React
- they are what they are
- can be manipulated on their own
- something like a header can hold things like JS, CSS, MarkUp etc, then be used elsewhere as its own component

# always work out of src in a react app

# public -- index.html
- unable to touch this
- stay out of this folder

# index.js in src = entry point

# john deleted out contents of app.js to write own code with classes

# look at 5.11 code/demo for Wed/Thur lab
